\subsection{Granger causality and feedback} \label{sec:granger-causality}
Framework for causality testing was first proposed by Granger \cite{granger69} in 1969.
The original formulation had a general form with an example of a linear autoregressive model provided, further described in \fref{sec:linear-ar}.

Consider two time series $X_t$ and $Y_t$ of length $n$, which are assumed to be weakly stationary.
Lets denote an optimal, least-squares predictor of some time series $X_t$ given another time series $Y_t$ by $P_t(X|Y)$.
The residual errors of the model and its variance are defined as follows: 
$\varepsilon_t(X|Y) = X_t - P_t(X|Y)$ and $\sigma^2(X|Y) = var[\varepsilon_t(X|Y)]$.
Lastly, all available information until time $t$ will be denoted $U_t$.

Given such notation the following definitions are proposed:

\begin{definition} \label{def:causality}
	Causality

	If $\sigma^2(X|U) < \sigma^2(X|U-Y)$, then $Y_t$ causes $X_t$, denoted as $Y_t \Rightarrow X_t$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Feedback

	If $\sigma^2(X|U) < \sigma^2(X|U-Y)$ and $\sigma^2(Y|U) < \sigma^2(Y|U-X)$, then there is feedback between $X_t$ and $Y_t$, denoted as $Y_t \Leftrightarrow X_t$.
\end{definition}

The completely unrealistic aspect of the formulation above is having access to the full information $U_t$.
In practice those definitions allow to construct statistical tests and to reason for causal relations between time series.

\subsubsection{Linear autoregressive model} \label{sec:linear-ar}
A simple realization of Granger causality test can be implemented using a two-variable linear autoregressive (AR) model of order $p$.
Two linear predictors of $X_t$ can be constructed as follows:

\begin{equation}
X_t = \sum_{i=1}^{p} \alpha_i X_{t-i} + \varepsilon_{X,t}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
X_t = \sum_{i=1}^{p} a_i X_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^{p} b_i Y_{t-i} + \varepsilon_{X|Y,t}
\end{equation}

where: $p$ is the order of AR model, $\alpha$, $a$, $b$ are scalar coefficients and $\varepsilon_{X,t}$, $\varepsilon_{X|Y,t}$ are residual errors of the models.
Causal relationship $Y_t \Rightarrow X_t$ can be inferred by comparing variance of residual errors $\varepsilon_{X,t}$ and $\varepsilon_{X|Y,t}$, as stated in \fref{def:causality} in \fref{sec:granger-causality}.
%If $\sigma^2_{X|Y,t} > \sigma^2_X$ then $Y_t \Rightarrow X_t$
%Then, comparing variance of residual error produces a Granger causality index:
%\begin{equation}
%	C_{Y \Rightarrow X} = ln \frac{\sigma^2_{X}}{\sigma^2_{X|Y}}
%\end{equation}
%where, $\sigma^2_{X}$ and $\sigma^2_{X|Y}$ are variances of $\varepsilon_{X,t}$ and $\varepsilon_{X|Y,t}$ respectively.
%If $C_{Y \Rightarrow X} > 0$, that is $\sigma^2_{X} > \sigma^2_{X|Y}$, then 
%$Y_t \Rightarrow X_t$.
