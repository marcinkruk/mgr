\textbf{Summary}
\end{center}

A multiscale linear and nonlinear Granger causality analysis was performed for U.S. Dollar exchange rate and crude oil price.
Time series were decomposed into multiple time scales using the discrete wavelet transform.
Linear Granger causality test and nonlinear Diks-Panchenko test were applied to each pair of bands of wavelet decomposed data.
Fourier phase randomisation method for surrogate data generation was employed to verify obtained results.
TODO: something about results and conclusions.
